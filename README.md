# Fighting Corona
We are a group of TJ students interested in the independent production of masks and other materials that are in very short supply during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our purpose is to organize households across the DMV into a production center for masks and other materials to ship to sites around the US in dire need of them. Epicenters of the outbreak including New York City, Seattle, and Chicago, are being contacted to gauge what materials are in need.
